    "text": "1.1 How Did Pit Bull Discrimination Begin?\nPit Bulls have a long history with humans, originally bred in the United Kingdom in the early 1800s from Old English Bulldogs for bull and bear baiting. After such practices were banned in 1835, Pit Bulls were used in ratting contests, where they got their name from being placed in pits (Love-A-Bull).\nWhen immigrants brought them to the United States, they became known as American Pit Bull Terriers, celebrated during World War I and II as the ‚ÄúAll-American Dog‚Äù for their loyalty, bravery, and friendliness. However, public opinion began to shift in the 1970s after the U.S. outlawed dog fighting. Sadly, this led to Pit Bulls being bred for underground fights, with temperament and socialization ignored (Love-A-Bull).\nBy the 1980s, negative media portrayals fueled public fear, leading to breed-specific legislation (BSL) that targeted Pit Bulls and other breeds, often banning them from entire cities and states (Love-A-Bull). This history of stigma continues to affect Pit Bulls today, despite evidence showing they are no more dangerous than other breeds when properly cared for."

    "text": "3.1 Does BDL Make Communities Safer?\nüëâ No, it does not.\nMultiple peer-reviewed studies and reviews, including those from the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), have found no evidence that BDL reduces dog bites or makes communities safer. In fact, cities that enacted these laws saw no reduction in incidents (AVMA 2014). BDL-based policies are based on myths and misinformation instead of science or credible data, it further divert resources from more effective animal control and public safety initiatives (Humane World for Animals).\n\n‚ÄúThere is no evidence that breed-specific bans reduce the rate or severity of bite injuries.‚Äù ‚Äî AVMA Literature Review, 2014"
